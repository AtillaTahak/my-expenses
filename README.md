# Budget mobile app

> Ruby or Rails capstone project
# Description
The Ruby on Rails capstone project is about building a mobile web application where you can manage your budget: you have a list of transactions associated with a category, so that you can see how much money you spent and on what.

You will create a Ruby on Rails application that allows the user to:

register and log in, so that the data is private to them.
introduce new transactions associated with a category.
see the money spent on each category.
